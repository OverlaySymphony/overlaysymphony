# OverlaySymphony

An interactive streaming framework for orchestrating overlays, bots, and other services.

> Note: This project is still very much under development. I use it actively on my own stream, so all releases should be fully functional. I will do my best to follow semver, though I cannot make any guarantees about release timelines or stability at this time.
